# Livecut 64-bit

Livecut 64-bit community builds.

Original 32-bit code open sourced by [mdsp](https://github.com/mdsp/Livecut) &amp; updated to 64-bit by fellow Livecutters around the globe.

The purpose of this project is to build, test, & provide 64-bit releases of Livecut.

<!-- Do not submit plugin bugs/issues here. Any bugs/issues should be submitted to the fork of Livecut you are using. Feel free to discuss JUCE & VST_SDK build issues here. -->

### Project structure

Right now all dependencies are manually installed @ `./third_party` & `./vendor`. This will probably change if/when I decide between using git submodules, subtrees, or [subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo)s.
